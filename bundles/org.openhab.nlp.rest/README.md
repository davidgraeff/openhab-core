# NLP Rest interface

The natural language processor (NLP) bundle installed on its own is already useful
for voice interaction. This REST bundle allows to interact with the NLP via a
simple REST interface.

Just send your sentence to `/nlp/chat` and corresponding actions are performed and
and an answer is generated. Use `/nlp/greet` for an initial greeting.
